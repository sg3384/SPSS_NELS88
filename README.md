#### My Contribution
I completed the Data Analysis and Syntax Documentation for the paper as a part of a technical group project. To reach the hypothesis of predicting the reading scores and choosing the variables for analysis, I ran more than 70 models for initial analysis which are not documented in the syntax. I also wrote the results from analysis for the paper along with the final conclusion. 

I further, for my own interest, curiosity and development generated various graphs and visualizations along with a Powerpoint presentation. The technical group project mentioned earlier did not include visualizations and hence all the vizualisations in the github repo Report (genrated in powerpoint) are separate from the project and my own which were generated at a later stage. The Syntax file inlcuded was created and maintained by me alone.
