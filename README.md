# Predict Reading Scores using NELS88 Data

### Skills utilized by Shreya include: 
SPSS, Word, Power Point, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, Model Selection, Regression, Data Analysis, Documentation of Synatx and Analysis

### Data Source:
NELS88 - National Education Longitudnal Study 1988 (Public Data Source).

### Syntax File SPSS (Code) includes:
Descriptive Analysis + Cleaning Data + Mutating Variables + Regression Models


Shreya completed the Data Analysis and Syntax Documentation for the paper as a part of a technical group project. To reach the hypothesis of predicting the reading scores and choosing the variables for analysis, she ran more than 70 models for initial analysis which are not documented in the syntax. She was also responsible for writing the results from analysis for the paper and final proof reading of the paper for improvement.

Shreya further, for her own interest out of her own curiosity and development generated various graphs and visualizations along with a Powerpoint presentation. The technical group project mentioned earlier did not include visualizations and hence all the vizualisations in the github repo Report (genrated in powerpoint) are separate from the project and her own which were generated at a later stage. The Syntax file inlcuded is her own work alone.
